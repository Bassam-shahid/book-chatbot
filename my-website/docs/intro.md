# Introduction to AI-Native Driven Development

Welcome to **AI-Native Driven Development: The definitive guide to building AI-native applications and systems**.

This comprehensive book will guide you through the essential concepts, patterns, and practices for developing applications where AI is not just an add-on feature, but a core architectural component.

## What You'll Learn

- **Foundational concepts** of AI-native systems and how they differ from traditional applications
- **Data management strategies** for AI-native applications including pipelines, feature stores, and real-time processing
- **Model development and deployment** workflows for production-ready AI systems
- **User experience design** principles for AI-powered interfaces
- **Scaling and optimization** techniques for high-performance AI applications

## Getting Started

AI-native applications represent a paradigm shift from traditional software development. Instead of building applications that occasionally use AI, we design systems where artificial intelligence is a first-class citizen in the architecture, influencing data flow, user interactions, and system behavior from the ground up.

This book is structured to take you from fundamental concepts to advanced implementation strategies, providing both theoretical understanding and practical examples.

### Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Software engineers looking to integrate AI into their applications
- Data scientists wanting to understand production deployment
- Product managers planning AI-native features
- Architects designing AI-powered systems
