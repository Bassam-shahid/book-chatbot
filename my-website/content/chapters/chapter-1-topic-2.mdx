# Architecture Patterns for AI Integration

## Service-Oriented AI Architecture

The service-oriented approach treats AI capabilities as independent services that can be consumed by various applications. This pattern provides several benefits:

- **Scalability**: AI services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Reusability**: Multiple applications can leverage the same AI capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Updates to AI models don't require changes to consuming applications

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing service-oriented AI architecture, consider:

1. **API Design**: Create clean, well-documented APIs for AI services
2. **Versioning**: Implement robust versioning strategies for models
3. **Caching**: Use intelligent caching to improve response times
4. **Monitoring**: Track model performance and usage patterns

## Pipeline Architecture

For complex AI workflows, pipeline architecture provides a way to chain multiple processing steps together. Each step in the pipeline performs a specific transformation on the data.

### Key Components

- **Data Ingestion**: Collect and validate input data
- **Preprocessing**: Transform raw data into model-ready format
- **Model Inference**: Apply trained models to generate predictions
- **Post-processing**: Format and validate model outputs
- **Storage**: Persist results and feedback for future learning

## Event-Driven AI Systems

Event-driven architectures are well-suited for AI systems that need to respond to real-time data streams. Events trigger AI processing workflows, enabling reactive and adaptive behavior.

### Benefits

- **Real-time Processing**: Can respond immediately to new data
- **Decoupling**: Components can evolve independently
- **Scalability**: Can handle variable loads efficiently
- **Resilience**: Failures in one component don't necessarily affect others

## Hybrid Approaches

Most production AI systems use hybrid approaches that combine multiple architectural patterns. The key is to choose the right pattern for each specific use case while maintaining overall system coherence.
