# Training and Evaluation Workflows

## The ML Lifecycle

Machine learning model development follows a cyclical process that includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Effective training and evaluation workflows are essential for producing high-quality models that perform well in production.

### Key Phases

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean, transform, and validate data for training
2. **Model Training**: Train models using prepared data
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics
4. **Model Validation**: Ensure models meet business requirements
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy validated models to production
6. **Model Monitoring**: Track model performance and data quality in production

## Training Workflows

### Data Pipeline Integration
Training workflows must integrate with data pipelines to ensure access to fresh, high-quality data. This integration should be automated and reliable.

### Experiment Tracking
Track all aspects of model training including:
- Hyperparameters used
- Training data versions
- Model metrics and performance
- Code versions and dependencies
- Computational resources used

### Model Versioning
Implement robust versioning for:
- Training data
- Model code
- Model artifacts
- Feature definitions
- Evaluation metrics

## Evaluation Strategies

### Cross-Validation
Use cross-validation to assess model performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting. Common approaches include k-fold cross-validation and time-series split validation.

### Holdout Sets
Maintain separate holdout sets for final model evaluation. These sets should never be used during training or hyperparameter tuning.

### Business Metrics
Include business-relevant metrics in evaluation alongside traditional ML metrics. These might include:
- Revenue impact
- User engagement
- Cost savings
- Efficiency improvements

## Automated Training Pipelines

### CI/CD for ML
Implement continuous integration and deployment for machine learning models, similar to traditional software development. This includes:
- Automated testing of model quality
- Automated deployment to staging environments
- Gradual rollout to production
- Automated rollback procedures

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Automate hyperparameter optimization using techniques such as:
- Grid search
- Random search
- Bayesian optimization
- Evolutionary algorithms

## Model Validation

Before deploying models to production, validate:
- Performance on holdout data
- Robustness to data drift
- Fairness across different demographic groups
- Compliance with regulatory requirements
- Computational efficiency requirements

## Monitoring and Retraining

### Performance Monitoring
Continuously monitor model performance in production and trigger retraining when performance degrades.

### Data Quality Monitoring
Monitor input data distributions and quality to detect data drift that might affect model performance.

### Feedback Loops
Implement mechanisms to collect feedback on model predictions and use this feedback to improve future models.

## Best Practices

- **Reproducibility**: Ensure all aspects of training can be reproduced
- **Automation**: Automate as much of the workflow as possible
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of all processes
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing at each stage
- **Security**: Protect training data and model artifacts
